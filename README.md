Hi! My name is TankieTwitch, I'm an avid gammer, artist and graphic designer with over 20 years experience with desktop publishing.

## I :hearts: **The Icon Library Project!** How can I support?

The library will always be free - but donations are always welcome beacuse they allow me to purchase art directly from artists, maintain my subscriptions to various sites and pay for the tools I use in creating these icon image. Every little bit helps and will be greatly appreciated! You can support my work by donating thru [**ko-fi.com**](https://ko-fi.com/theiconlibraryproject)
