The library will always be free - but donations are always welcome beacuse they allow me to purchase art directly from artists, maintain my subscriptions to various sites and pay for the tools I use in creating these icon image. Every little bit helps and will be greatly appreciated! You can support my work by donating thru [**ko-fi.com**](https://ko-fi.com/theiconlibraryproject)
