## I :hearts: **The Icon Library Project!** How can I support?
The library will always be free - but donations are always welcome beacuse they allow me to purchase art directly from artists, maintain my subscriptions to various sites and pay for the tools I use in creating these icon image. Every little bit helps and will be greatly appreciated! You can support my work by donating thru my ko-fi
